## Purpose

This project provides a ReleaseRetention class that processes project releases and deployments to identify releases that should be retained according to specified rules (e.g., keeping the N most recent releases per project/environment).

## Features

- Analyzes releases across multiple projects and environments
- Considers deployment recency to prioritize retention
- Efficiently handles memory usage through caching

## Algorithm and Data Structures

- HashSet
- Linked List
- Dictionary

## NuGet Packages Used

- xUnit: for unit testing.
- AutoFixture: for generating test data.
- Moq: for mocking dependencies during unit testing.
- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging: for logging interfaces.
- Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk: for running tests with the .NET SDK.
