# ðŸš¨ Continuous Deployment Retention Release Manager

A .NET tool for managing release retention policies, determining which releases to keep based on deployment history.

## Purpose

This project provides a ReleaseRetention class that processes project releases and deployments to identify releases that should be retained according to specified rules (e.g., keeping the N most recent releases per project/environment).

## Features

- Efficient tracking of deployments across multiple projects and environments
- Considers deployment recency to prioritize retentions
- Configurable capacity retention policy


## Algorithm and Data Structures

- HashSet
- Dictionary
- Doubly Linked List

## Doubly Linked List + Dictionary Approach

| Feature                          | Time Complexity    | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Insertion**                    | `O(1)`             | New releases can be added to the head or tail instantly               |
| **Removal**                      | `O(1)`             | Any release can be removed using a direct node reference              |
| **Reordering (Move to Head)**    | `O(1)`             | Recently deployed releases can be moved in constant time              |
| **Lookup (Find by Release ID)**  | `O(1)`             | Dictionary provides fast access reference to the nodes                |
| **Maintains Recency Order**      | `O(n log n)`       | Deployments are externally sorted before being passed                 |
| **Efficiently Keeps N Items**    | `O(1)`             | Easy to evict tail nodes beyond the allowed capacity                  |
